      this is enabled (in "host" mode") or disabled (in "peripheral" mode). The
      regulator is updated if the controller is configured in "otg" mode and the

    description:
      Tells usb driver the release number of the OTG and EH supplement with
      which the device and its descriptors are compliant, in binary-coded
      decimal (i.e. 2.0 is 0200H). This property is used if any real OTG
      features (HNP/SRP/ADP) is enabled. If ADP is required, otg-rev should be
      0x0200 or above.

  hnp-disable:
    description:
      Tells OTG controllers we want to disable OTG HNP. Normally HNP is the
      basic function of real OTG except you want it to be a srp-capable only B
      device.
    type: boolean

  srp-disable:
    description:
      Tells OTG controllers we want to disable OTG SRP. SRP is optional for OTG
      device.

      mode of controller at init.

    description: If present indicates that we need to reset the PHY when we 
      detect a wakeup. This is due to a hardware errata.
